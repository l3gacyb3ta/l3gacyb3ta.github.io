German Certifications
	AP Test : Reading, Listening, Presentation. Got a 5/5 on this! Mostly exciting for college credit
	DSD I : Writing, Reading, Listening, Essay, Pre-prepared Presentation, and a Spontaneous Presentation. This is enough to get the Georgia seal of biliteracy, and to cut my school requirements for Germany down a lot. Equivalent to a B2 CEFR level.
	DSD II : Same as the DSD I, just more advanced. I have completed this one at a CEFR C1 Level.

Spelling Reforms
	I before E except after C : I try to follow this rule 100% consistently, for example wierd instead of wierd
